(** macOS userspace network bridging. *)

(** [t] contains the interface state for one vmnet interface. *)
type t [@@deriving sexp_of]

(** [mode] controls the level of sharing exposed to the vmnet interface.

    - {!Host_mode} lets the guest network interface communicate with other
    guest network interfaces in the host mode and to the native host.
    - {!Shared_mode} lets the guest network interface reach the Internet
    using a network address translator.

    Note that in MacOS X Yosemite, {!Host_mode} also provides a NAT to the
    guest, but with the subnet and DNS options not set (so it has no way
    to communicate externally but can still retrieve host-local network
    configuration via DHCP). *)
type mode =
  | Host_mode
  | Shared_mode [@@deriving sexp]

(** [error] represents hard failures from the underlying vmnet functions. *)
type error =
 | Failure
 | Mem_failure
 | Invalid_argument
 | Setup_incomplete
 | Invalid_access
 | Packet_too_big
 | Buffer_exhausted
 | Too_many_packets
 | Unknown of int [@@deriving sexp]

(** [Error] can be raised by vmnet functions when hard errors are encountered. *)
exception Error of error [@@deriving sexp]

(** [Permission_denied] can be raised if the process needs root privileges
    (or the vmnet capability) *)
exception Permission_denied

(** [No_packets_waiting] is raised when {!read} is called on an interface that
   has no packets queued.  {!wait_for_event} can be used to block the client
   until packets do arrive. *)
exception No_packets_waiting [@@deriving sexp]

(** [init ?mode] will initialise a fresh vmnet interface, defaulting to
    {!Shared_mode} for the output. Raises {!Error} if something goes wrong. *)
val init : ?mode:mode -> unit -> t

(** [mac t] will return the MAC address bound to the guest network interface. *)
val mac : t -> Macaddr.t

(** [mtu t] will return the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) bound to the
    guest network interface. *)
val mtu : t -> int

(** [max_packet_size t] will return the maximum allowed packet buffer that can
    be passed to {!write}.  Exceeding this will raise {!Packet_too_big} from
    {!write}. This is also the minimum buffer size that must be passed to
    {!read}. *)
val max_packet_size: t -> int

(** [set_event_handler t] will initalise the internal thread state in the library
    that listen for event notifications from the library.  The {!wait_for_event}
    function should not be called until this {!set_event_handler} been called once. *)
val set_event_handler : t -> unit

(** [wait_for_event t] will block the current OCaml thread until an event
    notification has been received on the [t] vmnet interface. *)
val wait_for_event : t -> unit

(** [read t buf] will read a network packet into the [buf] {!Cstruct.t} and
   return a fresh subview that represents the packet with the correct length
   and offset.  It will raise {!No_packets_waiting} if there is nothing to read. *)
val read : t -> Cstruct.t -> Cstruct.t

(** [write t buf] will transmit a network packet contained in [buf].  This will
   normally not block, but the vmnet interface isnt clear on whether this might
   happen. *)
val write : t -> Cstruct.t -> unit
